Chapter 1: Greg

  It was a dark and stormy night -- or maybe it was just a normal night with average lighting;
  the Cognex Vision camera wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
  Greg was just finishing up his conversation with the assortment of ABB 6-DOF industrial
  robotic arms before heading home for the night. The arms waved to him as he wheeled
  his fixed-gear bike out the doors of the robotics lab. He walked down the main hallway
  of SW9 past the lecture hall and straight into the doors to exit the building. Whoever
  installed those doors must have used feet for proximity detection instead of meters, or
  they simply intended for people to take a nap while waiting for them to open. Greg
  hardly felt the impact, though, and continued out into the evening light.

  As he mounted his bike and prepared for his journey home, he felt the urge to stop. I'm not
  sure if he pulled the brakes or simply stopped moving his feet; the fixed-gear mechanism
  would have allowed him to do either. Greg shifted his focus toward SW3 and became
  mesmerized by the soft glow emanating from the area where students lock up their bikes.

  Greg approached the entrance to the main building of SW3, closest to the parking lot and
  locked up his bike. The stream of colours radiating through the window from the stairwell
  was intense: he couldn't help but to further investigate. Walking down the single
  flight of stairs to the basement level, the glow became a vibrant red. He peered through
  the locked double doors that ironically instructed security to not lock them. He was just
  able to differentiate the room label from the bath of red that surrounded him, when he
  heard the large vent to his back right rattle. He began to collapse instantaneously.
  His vision quickly blurred as the word "Planetarium" melted into darkness.


Chapter 2: Andrew

  Andrew has been sprinting in the forest for twenty days. "Andrew! You got us lost!", 
=======
  Andrew has been walking in the forrest for seven days. "Andrew! You got us lost!", 
  he yelled into the void. A short time later a mythical creature, that may or may not 
  have just been an oversized opossum, hollered back,  "Where is your state diagram?!" 
  Puzzled by the words of wisdom, Andrew reached for a branch and began to draw.

  Casting his eyes downward Andrew assessed the ground and found it too hard and rocky
  to be able to properly illustrate what would surely be a masterpiece of a state diagram.
  Upon this realization Andrew set off in search of ground more favourable for drawing on.

  Andrew walked until he came to a river. On the bank of the river was a flat soft muddy
  expanse perfect for drawing state diagrams. The only thing marring the surface were
  curious footprints. Ignoring the footprints (animal?, human?) Andrew started to draw
  a pristine state diagram representing .....
