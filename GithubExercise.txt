Bless us all TI

  Andrew has been sprinting in the forest for twenty days. "Andrew! You got us lost!", 
  he yelled into the void. A short time later a mythical creature, that may or may not 
  have just been an oversized opossum, hollered back,  "OOGA BOOGA, MSP430F5529LP" 
  Puzzled by the words of wisdom, Andrew reached for a branch and began to draw.

  Casting his eyes downward Andrew assessed the ground and found it too hard and rocky
  to be able to properly illustrate what would surely be a masterpiece of a state diagram.
  Upon this realization Andrew set off in search of ground more favourable for drawing on.
