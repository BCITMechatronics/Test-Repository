  Andrew has been sprinting in the forrest for twenty days. "Andrew! You got us lost!", 
  he yelled into the void. A short time later a mythical creature, that may or may not
  have just been an oversized opossum, hollered back,  "Where is your state diagram?!" 
  Puzzled by the words of wisdom, Andrew reached for a branch and began to draw.

  Casting his eyes downward Andrew assessed the ground and found it too hard and rocky
  to be able to properly illustrate what would surely be a masterpiece of a state diagram.
  Upon this realization Andrew set off in search of ground more favourable for drawing on.

  After hiking for hours without suitable drawing ground Andrew began to abandon all hope. 
  But suddenly only comparable to the angel Gabriel appearing before the prophet Ezekiel, 
  Greg arrived on his fixed gear road bike. "Need a lift?" Greg called out to Andrew with words
  that calmed his soul.

  Andrew ascended onto the wheel pegs of Greg's bike and they proceeded to tear through the forest
  with ease thanks to Gregs superb affinity with the bike. Covering a distance Andrew alone took
  hours to cover the fixed gear travelled in minutes arriving at a riverbank. "This, looks like what
  you were lokking for Andrew, I'll see you later". Andrew was in awe at the rich quality of the mud adjacent
  the river. The ingredients for a state diagram of the highest quailty were at hand.
  
  "Wait a minute..." Andrew realized something was off. He never told Greg what he was looking for how would he 
  know this riverbank was the prime location if he didn't know the purpose of this quest? But Andrew was too
  late. 'Greg' revealed that he was in fact Isaiah in disguise. "Nothing personal Andrew". Isaiah proceeded to shoot 
  Andrew leaving his body at the riverbank.
